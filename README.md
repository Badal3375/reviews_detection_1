Review Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
📖 Description

This project implements a review detection system (Sentiment Analysis) utilising both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. It analyzes customer reviews and classifies them into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Python

Machine Learning: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM

Deep Learning: LSTM / CNN / BERT

NLP: TF-IDF, Tokenization, Word Embeddings

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch

🔍 Approach

Machine Learning: Text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF / Bag of Words), and classification using ML models.

Deep Learning: Neural network models automatically learn contextual and semantic features from review text.

📈 Results

ML models are lightweight and efficient for smaller datasets.

DL models offer improved accuracy and enhanced contextual understanding on large datasets.

🎯 Conclusion

The project demonstrates how combining ML and DL approaches improves sentiment analysis performance and makes the system scalable for real-world applications.
